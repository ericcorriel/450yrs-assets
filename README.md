## Project statement
Companies have put the burden of dealing with their plastic waste on us for decades.

**That needs to change.**

 Instead, most plastic items will spend **centuries** slowly degrading into millions of smaller and smaller pieces.

“Change doesn’t come easy,” someone famous probably said. But it will never come unless enough people make their voices, opinions, and values heard, seen, and felt.

And that’s where you come in.
