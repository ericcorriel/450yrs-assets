# 450YRS stickers

*450YRS* is a nationwide participatory art movement that gives people a fun and easy way to nip at corporations for not providing better packaging options.

## Project statement
Companies have put the burden of dealing with their plastic waste on us for decades.

**That needs to change.**

Most plastic will take [at least 450 years](https://atleast450years.com) to disintegrate.

It’s time to hold companies accountable.

That’s where you come in.

## DIY
The "sticker sheet" files presented here will allow anyone to make their own DIY *450YRS* stickers sheets–see [detailed instructions and examples here](https://atleast450years.com/diy). The the files in the "individual-stickers" folder are meant to be stuck onto plastic objects digitally, meaning, if you have a photo of a plastic object and basic proficiency with digital photoediting, you can composite the sticker digitally onto any plastic object.
