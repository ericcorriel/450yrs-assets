## Project statement
Corporations have put the burden of dealing with their plastic waste on us for decades.

**That needs to change.**

Most plastic will take [at least 450 years](https://atleast450years.com#does-most-plastic-really-last-at-least-450-years) to disintegrate.

It’s time to hold corporations accountable.

That’s where you come in.

## How to make your own
Files in the ```8.5 x 11 sticker sheets``` folder will allow anyone to make their own DIY *450YRS* stickers sheets on 8.5" x 11" paper–see [detailed instructions and examples here](https://atleast450years.com/diy). 

Files in the ```individual stickers``` folder are transparent PNGs of individual stickers that are meant to be stuck onto plastic objects digitally, meaning, if you have a photo of a plastic object and basic proficiency with digital photo-editing, you can composite the sticker digitally onto a plastic object (assumedly for the purposes of posting to social media, for example).

## About the license
To be clear: I do not allow commercial use of this product or these templates; they are presented for individual use only. One of the main reasons for this is because it would be very easy for anyone to make the same stickers using cheap, vinyl (plastic) non-ecologically friendly paper, and sell it for cheaper–can’t have that!
